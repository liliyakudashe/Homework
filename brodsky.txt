Past the lists, temples,
past temples and bars,
past gorgeous cemeteries,
past big bazaars,
peace and sorrow,
past Mecca and Rome,
the blue sun is palim,
pilgrims walk the earth.
They are crippled, hunchbacked,
hungry, half-dressed,
their eyes are full of sunset,
their hearts are full of dawn.
Deserts whine behind them,
lightning flashes flash,
stars rise above them,
and birds hoarsely shout to them:
that the world will remain the same,
yes, it will remain the same,
dazzlingly snowy
and doubtfully tender,
the world will remain false,
the world will remain eternal,
perhaps understandable,
but still endless.
And, therefore, there will be no sense
in believing in oneself and in God.
..And, therefore, only
the illusion and the road remained.
And to be above the earth for sunsets,
and to be above the earth for sunrises.
Fertilize it for the soldiers.
To approve it to the poets.
