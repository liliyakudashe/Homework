I leave the city like Theseus
leaves his Labyrinth, leaving the Minotaur
to stink and Ariadne to coo
in the arms of Bacchus.
 Here it is, victory!
The apotheosis of asceticism! God
sets up a meeting just then,
when we, having completed our business in the center,
are already wandering through the wasteland with our loot,
leaving these places forever,
never to return.

After all, murder is murder.
It is the duty of mortals to take up arms against monsters.
But who said that monsters are immortal?
And - so that we could not imagine
ourselves different from the defeated -
God takes away all reward
(secretly from the eyes of the cheering crowd)
and tells us to be silent. And we're leaving.

Now it really is forever.
After all, if a person can return
to the place of crime, then
he will not be able to come to the place where he was humiliated.
And at this point, the plans of the Deity
and our sense of humiliation
coincide so completely
that they remain behind: night,
a stinking beast, cheering crowds,
houses, lights. And Bacchus on the wasteland
is having fun in the dark with Ariadne.

I'll have to come back someday.
